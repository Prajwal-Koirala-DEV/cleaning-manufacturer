### **Formulation Guide**

#### Equipment Needed

- **Large Mixing Container** (for combining the ingredients)
- **Stirring Rod or Whisk** (for thorough mixing)
- **Storage Bottles** (to hold the finished liquid soap)

#### Instructions

1. **Safety First**

   - Wear gloves and protective eyewear when handling chemicals, especially preservatives and colorants.

2. **Prepare the Mixing Area**

   - Ensure you are in a well-ventilated area, preferably indoors with proper airflow.

3. **Measure and Mix**

   - **Step 1**: Pour **21 oz** of **Water** into the large mixing container. Water acts as the solvent to dissolve other ingredients.
   - **Step 2**: Add **4 oz** of **Sodium Laureth Sulfate** to the water. This surfactant will serve as the primary cleanser and foaming agent.
   - **Step 3**: Add **3 oz** of **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, which enhances the foam quality and adds mildness to the soap.
   - **Step 4**: Add **1 oz** of **Sodium Chloride** to thicken the mixture. Stir until fully dissolved.
   - **Step 5**: Mix in **1 oz** of **Glycol Distearate**, which will give the soap a pearlescent appearance.
   - **Step 6**: Add **1 oz** of your preferred **Fragrance** for a pleasant scent.
   - **Step 7**: Add **0.5 oz** of **Citric Acid** to adjust the pH to around 5.5 to 7 for skin compatibility.
   - **Step 8**: Add **0.03 oz** each of **Methylchloroisothiazolinone** and **Methylisothiazolinone** as preservatives to prevent microbial growth.
   - **Step 9**: Stir in a pinch of **Yellow 5** and **Red 40** to achieve the desired color.

4. **Mix the Solution**

   - Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure all ingredients are fully combined and uniform. This may take several minutes.

5. **Store Safely**

   - Pour the finished liquid soap into storage bottles. Store the soap in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.

6. **Usage**
   - Apply as needed for cleaning purposes. Shake the bottle before use if the soap separates.
