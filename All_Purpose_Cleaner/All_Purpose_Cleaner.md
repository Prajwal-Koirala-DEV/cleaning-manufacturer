- **Precision measuring tools** (e.g., graduated cylinders, pipettes, or electronic scales for accuracy)
- **Personal protective equipment (PPE)**: Gloves, safety goggles, and a mask to protect against direct contact with chemicals and fumes
- **Mixing equipment**: A stir rod or mechanical agitator for thorough mixing

---

## **Formulation Instructions**

### 1. **Safety Precautions**

- **Personal Protection**: Always wear gloves, safety goggles, and a mask when handling chemicals to minimize exposure to potentially harmful substances. Ensure good ventilation during the mixing process.
- **Flammability**: Several ingredients in the formulation (e.g., Dipropylene Glycol Butyl Ether, Benzyl Benzoate) are flammable. Avoid open flames and sparks in the mixing area.
- **Ventilation**: Work in a **well-ventilated area**, such as a fume hood or an outdoor space, to reduce inhalation of fumes from volatile chemicals.

---

### 2. **Prepare Your Work Area**

- **Workspace Setup**: Ensure the work area is clean, dry, and free of contaminants that may interfere with the formulation. Have all required tools and ingredients ready before beginning.
- **Temperature Control**: Ensure the workspace is at a moderate temperature between **60째F (15째C)** and **75째F (24째C)** to maintain the chemical stability of the ingredients.

### 3. **Step-by-Step Formulation Process**

1. **Base Solution: Water**  
   Pour **20 oz** of **Water** (7732-18-5) into the spray bottle. This serves as the solvent and forms the foundation of the cleaner.

2. **Add Sodium Hydroxide**  
   Carefully add **2 oz** of **Sodium Hydroxide** (1310-73-2). This caustic agent will break down grease, oils, and other stubborn residues, enhancing cleaning power.

3. **Incorporate Surfactants**

   - Add **1 oz** of **C9-11 Pareth-3** (68439-46-3), a primary emulsifier that reduces surface tension and allows the cleaner to spread effectively.
   - Add **1 oz** of **Dipropylene Glycol Butyl Ether** (29911-28-2) to solubilize oily residues and improve cleaning efficiency.
   - Add **1 oz** of **Dipropylene Glycol Propyl Ether** (29911-27-1), which helps dissolve hydrophobic substances and enhances the cleaning performance of the surfactants.
   - Add **1 oz** of **Lauramine Oxide** (1643-20-5) and **0.5 oz** of **Myristamine Oxide** (3332-27-2) to increase foaming action and emulsify dirt and oils.

4. **Add Chelators and Builders**  
   Add **1 oz** of **Tetrasodium EDTA** (64-02-8), which binds to metal ions in hard water and helps improve the performance of the surfactants by softening the water.  
   Add **1 oz** of **Trisodium NTA** (5064-31-3), a powerful chelator that enhances the overall detergent efficacy.

5. **Incorporate Fragrances and Active Ingredients**

   - Add **0.5 oz** of **Benzyl Benzoate** (120-51-4) and **0.5 oz** of **Diethyl Phthalate** (84-66-2) for a fresh, long-lasting fragrance. These fragrance components also aid in dissolving oils.
   - Add **0.5 oz** of **Geraniol** (106-24-1) for its antimicrobial properties and pleasant floral scent.

6. **Add Colorant**  
   Finally, add **0.1 oz** of **Direct Blue 86** (1330-38-7) to provide a visually appealing blue color, helping to distinguish the cleaner.

### 4. **Mixing the Solution**

- Secure the spray bottle lid and gently shake for **30-60 seconds** to ensure thorough mixing and homogeneity.
- **Viscosity Check**: The final product should have a slightly viscous consistency, indicating proper emulsification of the ingredients. If the mixture is too thin, consider adjusting the surfactant amounts.

---

### 5. **Storage Instructions**

- **Store in a Cool, Dry Place**: Keep the spray bottle in a **cool, dry place** away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and open flames.
- **Shelf Life**: This all-purpose cleaner has a shelf life of **12-18 months**, depending on storage conditions. Check for any signs of separation or change in color before use.

## **Usage Guidelines**

- **Surface Testing**: Always conduct a patch test on an inconspicuous area of a surface before full application to ensure compatibility and prevent potential damage, especially on sensitive or delicate surfaces.
- **Application**: Spray directly onto the surface to be cleaned. Allow the cleaner to sit for 1-2 minutes to break down dirt and grime before wiping it away with a clean cloth or sponge.
- **Repeat if Necessary**: For heavily soiled surfaces, reapply the cleaner and let it sit for a few more minutes for improved results.
