## **Procedure**

### 1. **Safety Precautions**

- **Personal Protective Equipment**: Wear appropriate PPE throughout the preparation process. This includes gloves, goggles, and a respirator or face mask to protect against potential chemical exposure.
- **Ventilation**: Conduct the mixing and storage in a well-ventilated area, ideally with local exhaust ventilation or a fume hood. Many of the solvents used in this formulation may release fumes that can be harmful when inhaled in concentrated amounts.
- **Storage**: Ensure that the final product is stored in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated space, away from direct sunlight and heat sources.

### 2. **Prepare the Mixing Area**

- **Clean Workspace**: Ensure the workspace is free of contaminants that could affect the quality of the product. Clean the equipment and spray bottle thoroughly before use to avoid cross-contamination.
- **Ambient Temperature**: Ensure that the workspace temperature is between 60°F and 75°F (15°C - 24°C) to avoid temperature fluctuations that could affect the chemical properties of the ingredients.

### 3. **Formulation Steps**

1. **Petroleum Distillates (Primary Solvent)**  
   Measure **15 oz (425 g)** of **Petroleum Distillates** and pour it into the spray bottle. Petroleum distillates act as the primary solvent, breaking down stubborn adhesive residues. This ingredient dissolves oils and resins, allowing for efficient removal of adhesive residues.

2. **Aliphatic Alcohol Ethoxylate (Solvent & Surfactant)**  
   Add **5 oz (142 g)** of **Aliphatic Alcohol Ethoxylate**. This ingredient functions as both a solvent and a surfactant, enhancing the solubility of oils and resins in the formulation. It also improves the wetting properties of the solution, allowing it to spread more easily over adhesive surfaces.

3. **d-Limonene (Citrus-Based Solvent & Fragrance)**  
   Add **5 oz (142 g)** of **d-Limonene** to the bottle. Derived from citrus peel, d-Limonene is a highly effective solvent that dissolves a wide range of adhesives while imparting a fresh, natural citrus scent. It is biodegradable and safer for users than many synthetic solvents.

4. **Acrylic Polymer Resin (Thickener)**  
   Add **3 oz (85 g)** of **Acrylic Polymer Resin** to thicken the formulation. The resin will provide a gel-like consistency that ensures the remover stays in place on vertical or inclined surfaces, preventing drips and allowing for prolonged action on the adhesive.

5. **Orange Sweet Extract (Natural Solvent & Fragrance)**  
   Add **2 oz (57 g)** of **Orange Sweet Extract**. This ingredient enhances the formulation's cleaning power and leaves a refreshing citrus fragrance. It also serves as a natural solvent that works synergistically with d-Limonene to break down adhesive bonds.

6. **Solvent Orange 60 & Solvent Red 18 (Colorants)**  
   To enhance the aesthetic appeal and ease of identification, add **0.5 oz (14 g)** of **Solvent Orange 60** and **0.5 oz (14 g)** of **Solvent Red 18**. These colorants give the formulation a vibrant color, making it easier to recognize and apply in professional environments.

### 4. **Mixing the Solution**

- **Agitation**: Secure the spray bottle’s lid and shake gently for 30-60 seconds, or use a mechanical shaker if available. The goal is to achieve a homogeneous solution with no visible separation of components.
- **Viscosity Check**: After mixing, check the viscosity of the solution. It should have a gel-like consistency. If the solution is too runny, consider adding a small additional amount of **Acrylic Polymer Resin** to thicken it further.

### 5. **Storage and Handling**

- **Store Properly**: Store the adhesive remover in its original spray bottle, kept in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area. Keep it away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and open flames due to the flammability of the solvents.
- **Shelf Life**: The shelf life of this formulation is approximately **12-18 months**, depending on storage conditions. Check for any changes in viscosity or smell, which could indicate degradation.

## **Usage Guidelines**

- **Surface Testing**: Always perform a spot test on an inconspicuous area of the surface before applying the remover to a larger area. This ensures compatibility with the substrate and prevents surface damage.
- **Application**: Spray the adhesive remover directly onto the adhesive residue. Allow it to sit for 1-2 minutes to soften the adhesive. Use a clean cloth, sponge, or scraping tool to remove the residue.
- **Rinse After Use**: After adhesive removal, rinse the surface with water to remove any residual cleaner, particularly on food preparation surfaces or where residue could cause irritation.
- **Repeat if Necessary**: For stubborn adhesive residues, repeat the process, allowing the remover more time to penetrate and soften the adhesive.

## **Safety and Disposal**

- **Handling and Storage**: Always handle the product with care. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and inhalation of fumes. Use appropriate PPE as outlined.
- **Waste Disposal**: Dispose of any leftover or unused adhesive remover according to local environmental regulations. Do not pour down the drain or into water systems. Many of the solvents used may be harmful to aquatic life.
- **First Aid Measures**: In case of skin contact, wash immediately with soap and water. If the product comes in contact with the eyes, flush with water for 15 minutes and seek medical attention. If inhaled, move to an area with fresh air and seek medical advice if symptoms persist.
