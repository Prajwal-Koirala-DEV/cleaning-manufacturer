## **Formulation Steps**

1. **Petroleum Distillates (Primary Solvent)**  
   Measure **15 oz (425 g)** of **Petroleum Distillates** and pour it into the spray bottle. Petroleum distillates act as the primary solvent, breaking down stubborn adhesive residues. This ingredient dissolves oils and resins, allowing for efficient removal of adhesive residues.

2. **Aliphatic Alcohol Ethoxylate (Solvent & Surfactant)**  
   Add **5 oz (142 g)** of **Aliphatic Alcohol Ethoxylate**. This ingredient functions as both a solvent and a surfactant, enhancing the solubility of oils and resins in the formulation. It also improves the wetting properties of the solution, allowing it to spread more easily over adhesive surfaces.

3. **d-Limonene (Citrus-Based Solvent & Fragrance)**  
   Add **5 oz (142 g)** of **d-Limonene** to the bottle. Derived from citrus peel, d-Limonene is a highly effective solvent that dissolves a wide range of adhesives while imparting a fresh, natural citrus scent. It is biodegradable and safer for users than many synthetic solvents.

4. **Acrylic Polymer Resin (Thickener)**  
   Add **3 oz (85 g)** of **Acrylic Polymer Resin** to thicken the formulation. The resin will provide a gel-like consistency that ensures the remover stays in place on vertical or inclined surfaces, preventing drips and allowing for prolonged action on the adhesive.

5. **Orange Sweet Extract (Natural Solvent & Fragrance)**  
   Add **2 oz (57 g)** of **Orange Sweet Extract**. This ingredient enhances the formulation's cleaning power and leaves a refreshing citrus fragrance. It also serves as a natural solvent that works synergistically with d-Limonene to break down adhesive bonds.

6. **Solvent Orange 60 & Solvent Red 18 (Colorants)**  
   To enhance the aesthetic appeal and ease of identification, add **0.5 oz (14 g)** of **Solvent Orange 60** and **0.5 oz (14 g)** of **Solvent Red 18**. These colorants give the formulation a vibrant color, making it easier to recognize and apply in professional environments.

## **Mixing the Solution**

- **Agitation**: Secure the spray bottleâ€™s lid and **shake gently for 30-60 seconds** or use a mechanical shaker if available. The goal is to achieve a homogeneous solution with no visible separation of components.
- **Viscosity Check**: After mixing, check the viscosity of the solution. It should have a **gel-like consistency**. If the solution is too runny, consider adding a small additional amount of **Acrylic Polymer Resin** to thicken it further.

---

## **Usage Guidelines**

- **Surface Testing**: Always perform a **spot test** on an inconspicuous area of the surface before applying the remover to a larger area. This ensures compatibility with the substrate and prevents surface damage.
- **Application**: Spray the adhesive remover directly onto the adhesive residue. Allow it to sit for **1-2 minutes** to soften the adhesive. Use a **clean cloth, sponge, or plastic scraping tool** to remove the residue.
- **Tough Adhesives**: For tougher adhesive residues, wait for an additional **2-5 minutes** and use a **plastic scraper** to carefully lift the softened adhesive. Repeat the application if necessary.
- **Rinse After Use**: After adhesive removal, **rinse the surface with water** to remove any residual cleaner, particularly on food preparation surfaces or where residue could cause irritation.
- **Repeat if Necessary**: For stubborn adhesive residues, repeat the process, allowing the remover more time to penetrate and soften the adhesive.

## **Safety and Disposal**

- **Handling and Storage**: Always handle the product with care. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and inhalation of fumes. Use appropriate PPE as outlined.
- **Waste Disposal**: Dispose of any leftover or unused adhesive remover according to **local environmental regulations**. Do not pour down the drain or into water systems. Many of the solvents used may be harmful to aquatic life.
- **Safety Tip Box**:

  - **Wear gloves and eye protection** while handling.
  - **Use in a well-ventilated area** to avoid inhaling fumes.
  - **Keep away from flames or sparks** due to flammability of solvents.

- **First Aid Measures**:
  - **Skin Contact**: Wash immediately with soap and water.
  - **Eye Contact**: Flush with water for 15 minutes and seek medical attention.
  - **Inhalation**: Move to fresh air and seek medical advice if symptoms persist.
