## **Required Equipment**

- **32 oz Spray Bottle**: Made from chemical-resistant plastic, clearly marked for accurate measurement.
- **Precision Measuring Tools**: Graduated cylinders, pipettes, or scales for accurate measurements.
- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Safety goggles, nitrile gloves, and a respirator mask to protect against exposure.
- **Mixing Equipment**: Mechanical agitator, stir rod, or shaker to ensure thorough mixing.

---

## **Procedure**

### 1. **Safety Precautions**

- **Personal Protective Equipment**: Always wear appropriate PPE (gloves, goggles, respirator) to minimize exposure to chemicals.
- **Ventilation**: Ensure that mixing and storage occur in a **well-ventilated area** with a fume hood or exhaust ventilation to avoid inhalation of fumes.
- **Flammability Warning**: Some solvents (especially **Petroleum Distillates** and **d-Limonene**) are highly flammable. Keep away from heat sources, sparks, and open flames.
- **Storage**: Store in a **cool, dry, and well-ventilated area** away from direct sunlight and heat. Ensure containers are tightly sealed.

---

### 2. **Prepare the Mixing Area**

- **Clean Workspace**: Ensure the workspace is free from contaminants that could interfere with the quality of the adhesive remover.
- **Temperature Control**: Maintain a temperature between **60°F and 75°F (15°C - 24°C)** to ensure optimal chemical performance and prevent degradation.

---

### 3. **Formulation Steps**

1. **Petroleum Distillates (Primary Solvent)**  
   Measure **15 oz (425 g)** of **Petroleum Distillates** and pour into the spray bottle. Petroleum distillates effectively dissolve oils and resins, breaking down the adhesive bonds for easier removal.

2. **Aliphatic Alcohol Ethoxylate (Solvent & Surfactant)**  
   Add **5 oz (142 g)** of **Aliphatic Alcohol Ethoxylate**, which improves the solubility of the adhesive residue by lowering surface tension and enhancing penetration.

3. **d-Limonene (Citrus-Based Solvent & Fragrance)**  
   Add **5 oz (142 g)** of **d-Limonene**. This natural solvent, derived from citrus peel, works well with adhesives while offering a fresh fragrance. It is also biodegradable and safer than many synthetic solvents.

4. **Acrylic Polymer Resin (Thickener)**  
   Add **3 oz (85 g)** of **Acrylic Polymer Resin** to thicken the solution. This ensures the remover remains in place on vertical or angled surfaces for better adhesion removal.

5. **Orange Sweet Extract (Natural Solvent & Fragrance)**  
   Add **2 oz (57 g)** of **Orange Sweet Extract**. This ingredient enhances the formulation’s cleaning power and imparts a pleasant, natural citrus scent.

6. **Solvent Orange 60 & Solvent Red 18 (Colorants)**  
   Add **0.5 oz (14 g)** of **Solvent Orange 60** and **0.5 oz (14 g)** of **Solvent Red 18** to give the remover a vibrant color, improving product recognition and ease of application.

---

### 4. **Mixing the Solution**

- **Agitation**: Secure the spray bottle’s lid and shake it for **30-60 seconds** to ensure uniform dispersion. If possible, use a mechanical shaker for more efficient mixing.
- **Viscosity Check**: After mixing, check the solution’s consistency. It should have a **gel-like texture**. If too thin, add a small amount of **Acrylic Polymer Resin** for thickening.

---

### 5. **Storage and Handling**

- **Shelf Life**: This adhesive remover has a **12-18 month shelf life**, depending on storage conditions. Check for changes in **viscosity**, **color**, or **odor** to determine degradation.
- **Storage Conditions**: Store the remover in a **cool, dry place**, away from **heat sources** or direct sunlight. Keep the spray bottle tightly closed.

---

## **Usage Guidelines**

- **Surface Testing**: Before applying the adhesive remover on a large area, test it on a small, inconspicuous section of the surface to ensure compatibility.
- **Application**: Spray the remover directly on the adhesive residue and allow it to sit for **1-2 minutes** to soften the adhesive. Wipe away with a clean cloth or use a scraping tool for stubborn residues.
- **Repeat if Necessary**: For tough adhesives, reapply the remover and let it sit longer for better penetration.

---

### **Expanded Application Tips**

- **Vertical Surfaces**: The gel-like consistency ensures that the remover will adhere to vertical or angled surfaces without dripping. Use a **scraper** or **soft cloth** to wipe away the residue after the adhesive has softened.
- **Sensitive Surfaces**: For delicate surfaces (e.g., painted or polished surfaces), ensure that the remover does not cause damage. Perform a spot test before full application.

---

## **Safety and Disposal**

- **Handling and Storage**: Always store the product in a safe, **well-ventilated** area away from potential ignition sources.
- **Disposal**: Follow **local environmental regulations** for the disposal of chemical products. Do not pour the adhesive remover down drains or into water systems. Use **sealed waste containers** for disposal.
- **First Aid**:
  - **Skin Contact**: Wash with soap and water.
  - **Eye Contact**: Rinse immediately with water for 15 minutes. Seek medical help if irritation persists.
  - **Inhalation**: Move to fresh air immediately. Seek medical attention if symptoms like dizziness or headache persist.

## **Environmental Impact and Sustainability**

- **Low-VOC Formula**: The formulation is designed to have **low volatile organic compound (VOC)** emissions, making it safer for both users and the environment.
- **Biodegradability**: Key ingredients like **d-Limonene** and **Orange Sweet Extract** are **biodegradable**, reducing environmental impact.
- **Sustainable Sourcing**: The **d-Limonene** and **Orange Sweet Extract** are sourced from renewable citrus peel, offering a **green** alternative to petroleum-based products.

---

## **Scaling and Industrial Use**

- **Scaling Up**: When scaling up production, consider mixing in larger containers and adjusting the **mixing time** to ensure consistency across large batches.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Buying ingredients in **bulk** or sourcing **local materials** can help reduce production costs for industrial users.

---

## **Ingredient Alternatives**

For users seeking alternative formulations or environmentally friendlier options, consider the following substitutions:

- **Bio-based Solvents**: Replace **Petroleum Distillates** with **vegetable-based solvents** or **hydrocarbon bio-solvents**.
- **Plant-Based Thickeners**: For a more eco-friendly approach, use **xanthan gum** or **guar gum** as a natural thickener.
- **Non-Toxic Fragrances**: Consider replacing **d-Limonene** with **non-toxic essential oils** like **lavender** or **peppermint** for fragrance.
