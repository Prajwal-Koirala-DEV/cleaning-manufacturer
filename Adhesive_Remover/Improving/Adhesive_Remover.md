## Formulation Guide

#### Equipment Needed

- **4 oz spray bottle**
- **Safety gear**: Gloves, goggles, and a mask (to protect from fumes)

#### Instructions

1. **Safety First**  
   Wear gloves, goggles, and a mask when handling acetone and isopropyl alcohol. Work in a well-ventilated area, as these solvents have strong fumes.

2. **Prepare the Mixing Area**  
   Work outdoors or in a well-ventilated space. Ensure that the area is free of open flames or heat sources since acetone is highly flammable.

3. **Measure and Mix**

   - Pour **2 oz** of **Acetone (CAS 67-64-1)** into the spray bottle. This is the primary solvent for breaking down tough adhesives like super glue and resin-based glues.
   - Add **1.5 oz** of **Isopropyl Alcohol (CAS 67-63-0)** (90% or higher) to boost the solvent strength and help dissolve the adhesive quickly.
   - Add **0.5 oz** of **d-Limonene (CAS 5989-27-5)**, a citrus-based solvent that enhances adhesive removal and provides a fresh fragrance.
   - Add **0.25 oz** of **Coco Glucoside (CAS 141464-42-8)**, a mild surfactant to help emulsify oils and resins and improve cleaning power.

4. **Mix the Solution**  
   Secure the lid on the spray bottle and shake gently. The mixture should become uniform after shaking. If needed, shake again before use.

5. **Store Safely**  
   Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Keep out of reach of children or pets.

6. **Usage**
   - Spray directly onto the adhesive residue.
   - Allow it to sit for 1-2 minutes, letting the solvents break down the adhesive.
   - Wipe off with a cloth, sponge, or plastic scraper. Repeat the process for stubborn glue.

### Explanation of Ingredients:

- **Acetone (CAS 67-64-1)**: A very strong solvent that works to break down adhesives like super glue (cyanoacrylate), resin, and other tough glues. Acetone is commonly used in industrial-strength adhesive removers and nail polish removers.
- **Isopropyl Alcohol (CAS 67-63-0)**: An effective solvent on its own that dissolves sticky substances. At 90% or higher concentration, itâ€™s even more powerful and evaporates quickly, making it ideal for adhesive removal.
- **d-Limonene (CAS 5989-27-5)**: A natural citrus solvent that helps break down resins and oils. It also has a pleasant scent and enhances the cleaning action of the acetone and isopropyl alcohol.
- **Coco Glucoside (CAS 141464-42-8)**: A mild, plant-based surfactant used to emulsify oils and resins, making the removal of sticky substances easier and more effective.

### Notes:

- **Acetone** is highly effective at breaking down even the toughest adhesives, like super glue, epoxy, and resin-based adhesives.
- **Isopropyl Alcohol** increases the strength of the formula and helps it evaporate quickly, reducing residue.
- **d-Limonene** enhances the solvent power while adding a pleasant citrus fragrance, which helps mask the strong smell of acetone.
- **Coco Glucoside** provides emulsifying action, ensuring better penetration and removal of sticky residues.
