### Additional Notes

- Always perform a patch test on a small area before widespread use to check for any adverse reactions.
- Dispose of any unused materials according to local regulations to ensure safety and environmental protection.

### Explanation of Ingredients:

- **Petroleum Distillates (CAS 64742-47-8)**: These are common solvents used to break down sticky substances and adhesives.
- **Aliphatic Alcohol Ethoxylate (CAS 9004-77-7)**: A non-ionic surfactant commonly used in cleaning products to help dissolve oils and resins, improving the cleaning power of the formulation.
- **d-Limonene (CAS 5989-27-5)**: A citrus-derived solvent with strong degreasing properties, often used for adhesive removers due to its natural origin and pleasant scent.
- **Acrylic Polymer Resin (CAS 25035-69-2)**: A thickening agent that provides the right viscosity for a gel-like texture in adhesive removers, allowing the product to cling to surfaces longer.
- **Orange Sweet Extract (CAS 8028-48-6)**: A natural solvent with cleaning and degreasing properties, often used to enhance the effectiveness of other solvents and add a pleasant scent.
- **Solvent Orange 60 (CAS 6925-69-5) & Solvent Red 18 (CAS 6483-64-3)**: These are colorants used to give the product its characteristic color for easy identification and to indicate its composition visually.
